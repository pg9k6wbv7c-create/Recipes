            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Roast the green chiles, onion, and garlic. You can do this by placing them under a broiler, on a grill, or directly over a gas flame until the skins are charred. Once roasted, place them in a sealed plastic bag for about 10 minutes to steam. Then peel off the skins, remove seeds if desired, and chop them finely.</li>
                <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork cubes and brown them on all sides. Remove the pork and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the roasted green chiles to the pot and stir to combine with the onions and garlic.</li>
                <li>Return the browned pork to the pot. Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the ground cumin and dried oregano. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the pork is tender.</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
